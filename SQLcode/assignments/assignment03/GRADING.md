### Task (e): 
Unfortunately, these are not the first 5 lines of the script in the orignal order
but probably the 5 longest lines.
Step 1: select the first 5 lines containing "force"
Step 2: order these 5 by length of the dialogue.

### Task (g):
Where is your C3PO_try2.json? I tried it out and the formatting was good. However,
in the json file you uploaded the formatting differed slightly from the description
in the task. Instead of 

Description:
[{"id":1,"dialogue":"Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!"},
{"id":2,"dialogue":"We're doomed!"}, ...]

Yours:
[{
    "id":1,
    "dialogue":"Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!"
    },
{
    "id":2,
    "dialogue":"We're doomed!"}, ... ]
